My android device is not rooted.
Thats why I cannot access its data to sync it.
I need to save my files manually into a directory, which I have assigned.

I have written a script that:
  checks every file in the directory and its sub-directories
  if the file has been recently modified, it sends it via scp and ssh to my server.
  it also updates the variable that stores the time of the latest change to any file currently on the server

I have installed termux:widget
I have put the script into the .shortcut folder.
I have created a widget on the home screen.
I can use it to sync it without opening termux manually.

The workflow looks like this:
I create a file in Samsung Notes. 
I save it to disk on my tablet (into the assigned directory).
I go to my home screen and tab on the widget. 
--> It gets synced to my server.
